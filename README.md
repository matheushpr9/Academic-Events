# Academic events V1.0.0

This is a project developed in Java for the subjects of software architecture and object-oriented programming. Its focus is to meet the demands of an academic event manager.

## Current status

The application is not 100% finished, so I'm going to list how we should run it:

### Building the app

To upload the application, the dependencies must be resolved and the database created and fed.
To do this, we developed this script:

For linux:

``` bash
sh init_app.sh
```

For Windows:

``` bat
.\init_app.bat
```

### Author

To test the author's functionalities, which currently only involve creating articles.

You must log in with author test, where the login is *1* and the password *1*.

### Revisor 

To test the functionality of the Reviewer, which basically lists the articles you have created.

You must log in with the login *XXX.XXX.XXX-XX* and the password *K%JpG3XvN#bH5@nE!mqJSNc2HB4Sbwh*.
